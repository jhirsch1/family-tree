Born on September 25, 1915, in Mödling, Austria, Edmund was a pharmacist, as well as a skilled painter. He is recorded as living in Rimini, Italy, in 1940, and although it is unclear when he first arrived there, it was no earlier than 1938. Edmund, who went by the name Edmondo while in Italy, was one of just 23 Jews living in Rimini as of December 16, 1943. By July of 1940, he was interned in the Ferramonti di Tarsia internment camp in Tarsia, Italy. While interned, Edmund was able to receive financial assistance from the diocese of Rossano Calabro, which he would send to his mother, who remained in Poland. Edmund had learned to speak fluent Italian during his time in Rimini, and found work in the camp as a painter and photographer, while helping to put on theatrical activities during Jewish religious celebrations.

Edmund remained in the internment camp through the first few months of 1944. It is there that he met Margerita Ehrenfeld, a Jew from Vienna who had arrived at the camp with her parents in 1942 after being saved by the Italian Navy when an attempt to flee to Palestine ended in a shipwreck. They were married quickly, but the marriage was short-lived, ending in divorce around 1942 when Edmund decided to convert to Catholicism and get baptized, against the wishes of his wife. The two did not have any children together.

After liberation from the Ferramonti internment camp, Edmund was settled in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) camp in Bari, Italy on August 16, 1944. He remained there until at least June 26, 1946, after which it is unclear what happened to him. It is known that he intended to move to the United States, but whether or not he actually followed through with that or not is unclear. It is unknown if Edmund ever remarried or had any children, or when he died."\r

She was born on July 24, 1922, in Vienna, Austria, to Josef Ehrenfeld and Rosa Hindels, Slovakian Jews. She had one older brother, Fritz (Philipp) Ehrenfeld.

In the summer of 1940, along with her parents and over 400 other Slovakian Jews, Margerita attempted to flee from the rising antisemitism in Europe to Palestine. Departing from Bratislava, Slovakia, on May 18, 1940 aboard the S.S. Pentcho, they set sail down the Danube River, stopping in Sulina, Romania, to pick up about 100 Austrian Jews, bringing the total number of passengers to over 500. They left Sulina on September 21, 1940, crossing the Black Sea and arriving at the Greek port of Mitilini, on the island of Lesbos. However, the ship was forced to leave port without refueling. The passengers contacted the Committee for the Relief of Refugees (CRR) in Athens to explain their situation, and were allowed to restock in Piraeus, Greece, just outside of Athens.

Leaving Piraeus on October 3, 1940, they reached Rhodes, Greece, four days later, and were allowed to restock again but were ordered to leave the next day. On October 9, the ship's boiler exploded while at sea, and the ship broke in two off the coast of Kamilonissi, a deserted island under Italian control. The passengers were able to reach shore, along with their supplies, before the S.S. Pentcho sank. A few men took the only lifeboat to look for help, and were eventually rescued by a British ship. When the CRR learned of what had happened, they had supplies delivered to the island with the help of the Greeks. On October 18 and 19, Italian authorities picked up the stranded refugees and took them to Rhodes, where they remained in a makeshift camp for the next year and a quarter. Finally, in January 1942, they were transferred to the Ferramonti di Tarsia internment camp in Tarsia, Italy, near Cosenza, Calabria, Italy, where they remained until the liberation of Italy by the Allied Forces in 1944.

It was there that Margerita met and married Edmund in about 1942, although their marriage was short-lived, as they divorced when Edmund converted to Catholicism against Margarita's wishes, in about 1944. By May of that year, Margarita's parents, along with eventually the large majority of the other passengers of the S.S. Pentcho, finally made it to Palestine. Margerita, however, was settled in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) camp in Bari, Italy, where she remained until at least June 26, 1946. There, she met and married her second husband, Adolf Sebald Kellner, and the two were able to immigrate to the United States, where in 1948 they had a daughter, Ruth Ida Kellner. Margerita, who spelled her name Margaretha in the U.S., died on May 28, 1991, in Queens, New York."\r

On the ship manifest, Leopold noted that his passage was paid for by a friend of his named Arde Bulova, who was also listed as Leopold's closest friend/relative in his destination country. It is unclear how he knew Arde Bulova, who was born in America to Czech immigrants. Bulova lived on Fifth Avenue in New York City and was a well-known businessman and watch-manufacturer who ran the Bulova Watch Company, which made watches and other time-keeping devices. One guess as to their relationship is that Leopold was hired as an employee by Bulova, which could explain why Bulova paid for Leopold's passage to the U.S. and why Leopold listed Bulova as his closest contact in the U.S.

It is unclear how long, or even if, he worked for Arde Bulova, as on October 16, 1940, Leopold registered for the World War II U.S. Army draft in Cairo, Illinois, and it can be assumed that by this point he was living in Illinois. He entered military service on April 16, 1941 in Chanute Field, Illinois, a U.S. Army Air Forces base, and served for some period of time as a Sergeant, though it is unclear where he served. Less than two years later, on June 30, 1942 in Chanute Field, Illinois, Leopold became a naturalized citizen of the United States of America. By this point, or upon his naturalization, his name was changed by court order to Lee Roy Taylor. It is unclear why he changed his name, aside from the fact that the name Verstaendig probably stood out in a place like Illinois, while a name like Lee Roy Taylor sounded more American in a time of increased antisemitism.

On March 17, 1943, Lee Roy married Katherine Lucille Becker in St. Louis, Missouri. The two lived in Memphis, Tennessee for at least some time in 1945, when they had a daughter, Susan Kay. However, their daughter only lived for about two weeks. Lee Roy died on July 17, 1977 in St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of 58. He was buried alongside his wife at the Bellerive Gardens Cemetery in Creve Coeur, Missouri, the same cemetery where the famous baseball player Stan Musial is buried, as well as the legendary musician Chuck Berry."\r

He was a national junior table tennis champion, and helped Poland win bronze at the 1935 Swaythling Cup World Table Tennis Championships in London.

She was born on December 12, 1903, in Vienna, Austria. She studied Montessori education and, early on in her career, taught at the Vienna House of Children. She was also a member of the Theosophical Society, and after attending the group's 50th anniversary in 1925 in Madras, India, (now Chennai), she decided to remain in India to work in the education system there. She started as the head of a Montessori school in Varanasi, India before establishing another Montessori school in Allahabad, India, in 1927. There, she befriended the influential Nehru family and, in 1929, married the Indian journalist and politician Benegal Shiva Rao. Kitty would occasionally travel to Germany to visit schools and learn about the latest developments in education. Her connections in India and Germany allowed her to help numerous Jews escape persecution and resettle in India.

Kitty continued to study child education, and advocated for the needs of children as well as women in the field. She got involved in the Indian women's rights movement by joining the All India Women's Conference, leading the Social and Legislation Section at their conferences in both 1941 and 1945 and becoming an important member of the group. She was appointed to lead a committee in charge of deciding what women expected from the new Constitution of India, and led the drafting of an Indian Women's Charter of Rights and Duties.

Kitty continued to promote causes related to women's and children's rights. Following the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, Kitty helped find employment for refugee women and was a large supporter and promoter of Indian handicrafts and textiles, serving as the Vice President of the All India Handicrafts Board. In addition, she pioneered the Indian Council for Child Welfare, and was influential in the passing of the Hindu code bills, which reformed the laws of India towards a common law code instead of being based on religious law. The bills were implemented by the Indian National Congress in the 1950s, led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The reforms led to major advancements in the rights of women in the country.

Kitty and her husband did not have any children. She died on February 9, 1980, in Bangalore, India, at the age of 76."\r

She used her mother's maiden name, Drucker, instead of her father's, Skulnik, likely because her parents had only had a religious marriage by the time of her birth, not a civil marriage, and so the government did not recognize her father's paternity. Sadie had one daughter in Poland, Ester Cirl Drucker. However, she was also not married, at least not legally, and the father of the child is unknown, as he was not even noted in the margins of her birth certificate as was often customary.

Max dropped out of school to start an apprenticeship, and sometime between then and 1938 he met his future wife, Ruth.

In England, Max worked as a farm laborer until the outset of World War II. In 1940, he was interned in England, as well as for a time Canada, before being returned to England.

According to notes written by Isidor Hirschhorn (his nephew), he moved to the United States for a time, before returning to Poland, which tracks with the fact that he is not listed on the 1890 Rzeszow census with his family, but reappears on the 1902 census as living with them. When exactly he was in the United States, and what he did there, is unclear, as is whether or not he ever married or had children. It is also unknown when Eliasz Chaim died.

*interestingly enough, there was another man named Elias Hirschhorn born in Rzeszow just two months after Eliasz Chaim, on August 20, 1867. This Elias Hirschhorn did get married and had three sons, Maurycy, Ignacy, and Fryderyk, and currently has living descendants in Belgium today. He was the son of a Lipe Hirschhorn, who himself was the son of a Mojzesz Hirschhorn. While it is likely that this family is related to ours, as they were all neighbors in Rzeszow and shared a last name, it is unclear exactly how they are related, although Mojzesz Hirschhorn would have been the same generation as Abraham Wolf Hirschhorn, so it is possible they were brothers. The families certainly would have known each other, at the very least."\r

He was born on April 22, 1874 in Rzeszow, Poland. He appeared as living with his family in Rzeszow in the 1880, 1890, 1902, and 1910 censuses. By 1910, they were living in a building owned by Shulem Rosenwasser, the uncle of Ephraim's future wife Amelia Kornfeld, who he met when she went to live with her Uncle Shulem at the age of 14, after the deaths of both of her parents. 

Ephraim was a successful banker in Rzeszow; he was the manager of the Austro-Hungarian government bank in the city, and was well-known and well-respected. He was also well educated and well traveled, and was an ardent Zionist, involved in numerous organizations in Rzeszow including Poale Zion, a movement of Marxist-Zionist Jewish workers. In addition, he helped to found a Jewish newspaper in Rzeszow, although it only seems to have run for a few issues. Ephraim and Amelia were engaged in 1914. He was 40, she was 21. Amelia's Uncle Shulem disapproved of the union largely because of Ephraim's age, his involvement in the Zionist movement which Shulem was against, and because Ephraim was not very religious. 

Before they could get married, in late 1914, they fled Rzeszow to Prague, Czech Republic (then part of the Austrian Empire). Upon arriving in Prague, in December of 1914, they had a very rushed religious marriage, but did not have their official civil marriage until December 30, 1917. They had two sons in Prague, Isak Salomon (later Isidor) and David. Life in Prague was hard, as they were immigrants and did not have papers, not to mention that it was during World War I, but Ephraim found work at a refugee office and they were able to support themselves. They knew it was temporary. They had intended to return to Rzeszow. However, Amelia's brother Benjamin had by then established himself in the United States and wrote to her that they should join him. It took Amelia six months to persudae Ephraim to immigrate to the United States, but eventually she did.

They obtained their visas and left Prague, stopping first in Stuttgart to visit Ephraim's niece Philippine Ascher and her family, the Laubs, and then in Nuremberg to visit his brother Moses Jozef Hirschhorn and his family, before arriving in Cherbourg, France, in December of 1921. Upon arrival, they sat through a week long inspection, after which they were finally allowed to board the boat. However, after boarding, they received a message that they would have to debark: the border had been closed, and their sons would have been allowed to leave as they were Czech citizens, but Ephraim and Amelia would have to stay behind because they were Polish citizens. The whole family got off the boat, and remained in Cherbourg for six months, from December of 1921 until June of 1922. The day before their French visa would have run out, they were able to renew it. Eventually, they boarded the S.S. Majestic and set sail for the United States on June 28, 1922. They arrived in New York on July 4, 1922, and were welcomed by fireworks celebrating American Independence Day. The whole trip, Ephraim complained, but Amelia told him that if she could manage, he would be able to as well.

They were met in the United States by Amelia's brother Benjamin, who had been there since 1912. Ephraim and Benjamin did not get along well, but the family settled in to Newark, New Jersey, where Ephraim lived for the rest of his life. He did not take well to the United States and always harbored hopes of returning to Rzeszow, or making aliyah to Israel. Ephraim never learned English, and although Benjamin found him a job in a factory, Ephraim quit after a few days as he found it unfitting for a man with his background and experience to be working a job like that. He suffered health issues, including two strokes, the second of which caused his death in New Jersey on March 9, 1941. He was 66 years old. "\r
2m,Amelia Kornfeld,7 Apr 1893,"Olpiny, Podkarpackie, Poland",24 Apr 1983,"Baltimore, Maryland, USA",Solomon David Kornfeld,Beila Rosenwasser,Ephraim Hirschhorn,30 Dec 1917,"Prague, Prague, Czech Republic","Isidor Solomon Hirschhorn, David Hirschhorn",Abraham Schneider,10 Jun 1956,,,3.10m,"Amelia Kornfeld was the wife of Ephraim Hirschhorn. She was born on April 7, 1893, in the small town of Olpiny, Poland, to Solomon David Kornfeld and Beila Rosenwasser, their oldest child of four and only daughter. Her parents had been introduced to each other by the famous Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Nowy Sacz, where Beila's family was from. He was friends with both Solomon's father, Berl Kornfeld, and Beila's father, Joseph Rosenwasser. Amelia grew up in Olpiny, and went to Catholic school where the nun's who taught her called her by her mother's last name, Rosenwasser, since her parents had only had a religious marriage, not a civil one, so their marriage was not officially recognized. From a youing age Amelia had to help out with the housework and take care of her younger brothers, as her mother was often out of town peddling wares.

Amelia's mother died of tuberculosis in 1906, when Amelia was just 13, and her father died the next year of complications from a surgery. He had gone to Vienna for the operation and never returned. After both parents died, Amelia and her siblings were divided up among their mother's siblings: Benjamin went to live with an uncle in Nowy Wisnicz (likely Israel Rosenwasser, with his wife Gitel Gutfreund and their sons Simche and Judah), Joseph went to Nowy Sacz (likely to his aunt Scheindel Rosenwasser, with her husband Isaak Borgenicht and their children Mendel Leiser, Israel, and Perl), while Israel, at just 3 years old, was left with a Jewish woman who lived near Rzeszow, Poland, who they paid to take care of him. Amelia was also sent to Rzeszow, to live with her Uncle Shulem Rosenwasser, along with his wife Feige Reichwald and their two children, Zalman and Regina.

Shulem had a bit of a temper, but his wife was always kind to Amelia. Similarly, while she never got along too well with Regina, who was jealous of Amelia's good looks, she got along really well with Zalman, who was involved in the Zionist movement in Rzeszow. However, Shulem disapproved of Zionism and would often get angry with Zalman, and Amelia would often step in between the two to protect Zalman. Shulem ran a general store in Rzeszow, where Amelia was put to work. Instead of going to school, she learned to be a businesswoman. Above the store were apartments that Shulem rented out, including to the family of Ephraim Hirschhorn, who was involved in the Zionist movement with Zalman. Amelia and Ephraim fell in love, and were engaged in 1914, although Uncle Shulem disapproved of their engagement because Ephraim was almopst 20 years her senior, was not very religious, and was a Zionist.

Before they could get married, in late 1914, they fled Rzeszow to Prague, Czech Republic (then part of the Austrian Empire). Upon arriving in Prague, in December of 1914, they had a very rushed religious marriage, but did not have their official civil marriage until December 30, 1917.

It took Amelia six months to persuade Ephraim to immigrate to the United States, but eventually she did.

However, after boarding, they received a message that they would have to debark: the border had been closed, and their sons would have been allowed to leave as they were Czech citizens, but Ephraim and Amelia would have to stay behind because they were Polish citizens. The whole family got off the boat, and remained in Cherbourg for six months, from December of 1921 until June of 1922. During that time, Amelia learned French and took care of the family by cooking, cleaning, sewing, and taking on other odd jobs. The day before their French visa would have run out, they were able to renew them. Eventually, they boarded the S.S. Majestic and set sail for the United States on June 28, 1922.

They were met in the United States by Amelia's brother Benjamin, who had been there since 1912. Ephraim and Benjamin did not get along well, but the family settled in to Newark, New Jersey. Ephraim was not able to find work, so it was up to Amelia to take care of the family, and she did so by running a bed and breakfast out of their apartment. She raised her sons in Newark, where Ephraim died in 1941. Fifteen years later, Amelia remarried to Abraham Schneider, on June 10, 1956. Amelia lived a long a full life, dying in Baltimore, Maryland on April 24, 1983, at the age of 90."\r

They had one child together in Jaroslaw, a son named Henryk Maksymilian (later Max), before moving to Munich, Germany, arriving on September 15, 1908. Once in Munich, Chaim and Marjem had another child, a daughter named Franziska (later Fanny).

In October of 1908, Chaim Both opened a men's clothing and fashion store with his brother-in-law Jonas Zeimer, who had moved to Munich with them. By July of 1909, Chaim was the sole owner of the shop, and in 1912 they opened up a second location. Around 1930, his son became a partner in the business.

In the evening of November 9, 1938, the windows of many of Munich's Jewish shops were smashed by members of the S.A., including the windows of Chaim Both's shop, above which the family lived. The perpetrators were chased away by patrons of neighboring restaurants, but later that night ten S.A. members returned. Four of them forced their way into the Both family's apartment above the store. When Chaim, Marjem, and Max returned home that night at around midnight, Chaim was knocked down and dragged into his apartment while Marjem was forced onto the street, and she and Max were prevented from entering.

Chaim was held in a room of his apartment by an S.A. man named Schenk. According to Schenk, a sudden movement by Both caused him to fire his gun. Whether this is really what really occured is doubtful, as a later forensic investigation concluded that Chaim died from a relatively close-ranged shot to the forehead. Regardless, Chaim was fatally wounded that night, in the early hours of November 10, 1938, at the age of 62. "\r

In October of 1908, shortly after arriving in Munich, Marjem's husband and brother opened a men's clothing and fashion retailer together. The family business prospered, and by 1930 they had opened a second location, bought the building the first location was based, and her son Max had become a partner.

After that night, Marjem and Max were forced to vacate their apartment, and a month or two later the Both & Zeimer retailer of men's clothing was acquired by a non-Jewish German man. While Marjem's children were both able to flee Germany in the coming year, Marjem was not so lucky. On November 20, 1941, she was deported from Munich to Kaunas, Lithuania, with about 1,000 other Jewish men, women, and children, where she was murdered in a mass shooting just five days later, on November 25, 1941."\r

In 1955, she immigrated to the United States, where she completed an internship in Rhode Island and a residency at the New Britain General Hospital in New Britain, Connecticut. On July 16, 1960, while living in Hartford, Connecticut, Karoline became a naturalized U.S. citizen. She would go on to work as a doctor for many years at Cedar Crest Hospital in Newington, Connecticut, and then at the Rocky Hill Veterans Hospital in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, before retiring in 1977.

He was born on December 4, 1921, in Vienna, Austria, to Adolf Abraham Schneider and Josefine Grunfeld. He had two younger siblings, a sister named Gertrude and a brother named Robert, and the three were raised in Vienna in a non-religious Jewish family. As a child, Max was a member of the Red Falcons, a group for children of socialist families, until the group was banned in 1934, upon which time he joined the also-illegal Communist Youth of Austria (KJÖ) organization. Max dropped out of school to start an apprenticeship, and sometime between then and 1938 he met his future wife, Ruth. It was she that brought him to the Hashomer Hatzair socialist-Zionist youth organization, through which the two of them were able to emigrate to England in early 1939, after the annexation of Austria in March of 1938.

In England, Max worked as a farm laborer until the outset of World War II. In 1940, he was interned in England, as well as for a time Canada, before being returned to England. He began working as a metalworker in the arms industry, and married Ruth on August 2, 1941 in Leamington Spa, England. After the Moscow Declaration of October, 1943, Max volunteered for the British Army. Once finished with his training, he served in a Scottish infantry unit in France, Belgium, and Holland under the name of Peter Shelley, helping to liberate his homeland. However, in April of 1945, he was severely wounded in northern Germany. He was awarded for his bravery. Max and Ruth both survived the war, as did Max's younger sister, Gertrude. Unfortunately, Max's parents and younger brother did not. They were deported from Vienna on February 6, 1942, and were killed in an extermination camp near Riga, Latvia in early 1943.

In early 1947, Max and Ruth were able to move back to Austria, and in 1948 Max earned the high school diploma he had not been able to receive. In 1947, Max became active in the Communist Party of Austria, holding multiple positions in various regional offices, including serving in Vienna as the regional secretary in the 1960s. However, he was voted out of office in 1968 due to his support of the Prague Spring, and he left the party. He went on to work in the private sector, and after his retirement started serving in schools as a contemporary witness against fascism. He was regularly invited to give lectures and participate in discussions as a survivor of the Holocaust. Due to this work, Max was awarded the Golden Medal of Merit by the state of Vienna. Max died in Vienna, Austria on June 12, 2010, at the age of 88."\r

He was born on April 22, 1874 in Rzeszow, Poland. He appeared as living with his family in Rzeszow in the 1880, 1890, 1902, and 1910 censuses. By 1910, they were living in a building owned by Shulem Rosenwasser, the uncle of Ephraim's future wife Amelia Kornfeld, who he met when she went to live with her Uncle Shulem at the age of 14, after the deaths of both of her parents. 

Ephraim was a successful banker in Rzeszow; he was the manager of the Austro-Hungarian government bank in the city, and was well-known and well-respected. He was also well educated and well traveled, and was an ardent Zionist, involved in numerous organizations in Rzeszow including Poale Zion, a movement of Marxist-Zionist Jewish workers. In addition, he helped to found a Jewish newspaper in Rzeszow, although it only seems to have run for a few issues. Ephraim and Amelia were engaged in 1914. He was 40, she was 21. Amelia's Uncle Shulem disapproved of the union largely because of Ephraim's age, his involvement in the Zionist movement which Shulem was against, and because Ephraim was not very religious. 

Before they could get married, in late 1914, they fled Rzeszow to Prague, Czech Republic (then part of the Austrian Empire). Upon arriving in Prague, in December of 1914, they had a very rushed religious marriage, but did not have their official civil marriage until December 30, 1917. They had two sons in Prague, Isak Salomon (later Isidor) and David. Life in Prague was hard, as they were immigrants and did not have papers, not to mention that it was during World War I, but Ephraim found work at a refugee office and they were able to support themselves. They knew it was temporary. They had intended to return to Rzeszow. However, Amelia's brother Benjamin had by then established himself in the United States and wrote to her that they should join him. It took Amelia six months to persudae Ephraim to immigrate to the United States, but eventually she did.

They obtained their visas and left Prague, stopping first in Stuttgart to visit Ephraim's niece Philippine Ascher and her family, the Laubs, and then in Nuremberg to visit his brother Moses Jozef Hirschhorn and his family, before arriving in Cherbourg, France, in December of 1921. Upon arrival, they sat through a week long inspection, after which they were finally allowed to board the boat. However, after boarding, they received a message that they would have to debark: the border had been closed, and their sons would have been allowed to leave as they were Czech citizens, but Ephraim and Amelia would have to stay behind because they were Polish citizens. The whole family got off the boat, and remained in Cherbourg for six months, from December of 1921 until June of 1922. The day before their French visa would have run out, they were able to renew it. Eventually, they boarded the S.S. Majestic and set sail for the United States on June 28, 1922. They arrived in New York on July 4, 1922, and were welcomed by fireworks celebrating American Independence Day. The whole trip, Ephraim complained, but Amelia told him that if she could manage, he would be able to as well.

They were met in the United States by Amelia's brother Benjamin, who had been there since 1912. Ephraim and Benjamin did not get along well, but the family settled in to Newark, New Jersey, where Ephraim lived for the rest of his life. He did not take well to the United States and always harbored hopes of returning to Rzeszow, or making aliyah to Israel. Ephraim never learned English, and although Benjamin found him a job in a factory, Ephraim quit after a few days as he found it unfitting for a man with his background and experience to be working a job like that. He suffered health issues, including two strokes, the second of which caused his death in New Jersey on March 9, 1941. He was 66 years old. "\r

She was born on April 7, 1893, in the small town of Olpiny, Poland, to Solomon David Kornfeld and Beila Rosenwasser, their oldest child of four and only daughter. Her parents had been introduced to each other by the famous Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Nowy Sacz, where Beila's family was from. He was friends with both Solomon's father, Berl Kornfeld, and Beila's father, Joseph Rosenwasser. Amelia grew up in Olpiny, and went to Catholic school where the nun's who taught her called her by her mother's last name, Rosenwasser, since her parents had only had a religious marriage, not a civil one, so their marriage was not officially recognized. From a youing age Amelia had to help out with the housework and take care of her younger brothers, as her mother was often out of town peddling wares.

Amelia's mother died of tuberculosis in 1906, when Amelia was just 13, and her father died the next year of complications from a surgery. He had gone to Vienna for the operation and never returned. After both parents died, Amelia and her siblings were divided up among their mother's siblings: Benjamin went to live with an uncle in Nowy Wisnicz (likely Israel Rosenwasser, with his wife Gitel Gutfreund and their sons Simche and Judah), Joseph went to Nowy Sacz (likely to his aunt Scheindel Rosenwasser, with her husband Isaak Borgenicht and their children Mendel Leiser, Israel, and Perl), while Israel, at just 3 years old, was left with a Jewish woman who lived near Rzeszow, Poland, who they paid to take care of him. Amelia was also sent to Rzeszow, to live with her Uncle Shulem Rosenwasser, along with his wife Feige Reichwald and their two children, Zalman and Regina.

Shulem had a bit of a temper, but his wife was always kind to Amelia. Similarly, while she never got along too well with Regina, who was jealous of Amelia's good looks, she got along really well with Zalman, who was involved in the Zionist movement in Rzeszow. However, Shulem disapproved of Zionism and would often get angry with Zalman, and Amelia would often step in between the two to protect Zalman. Shulem ran a general store in Rzeszow, where Amelia was put to work. Instead of going to school, she learned to be a businesswoman. Above the store were apartments that Shulem rented out, including to the family of Ephraim Hirschhorn, who was involved in the Zionist movement with Zalman. Amelia and Ephraim fell in love, and were engaged in 1914, although Uncle Shulem disapproved of their engagement because Ephraim was almopst 20 years her senior, was not very religious, and was a Zionist.

Before they could get married, in late 1914, they fled Rzeszow to Prague, Czech Republic (then part of the Austrian Empire). Upon arriving in Prague, in December of 1914, they had a very rushed religious marriage, but did not have their official civil marriage until December 30, 1917.

During that time, Amelia learned French and took care of the family by cooking, cleaning, sewing, and taking on other odd jobs. The day before their French visa would have run out, they were able to renew them. Eventually, they boarded the S.S. Majestic and set sail for the United States on June 28, 1922.

Ephraim was not able to find work, so it was up to Amelia to take care of the family, and she did so by running a bed and breakfast out of their apartment. She raised her sons in Newark, where Ephraim died in 1941. Fifteen years later, Amelia remarried to Abraham Schneider, on June 10, 1956. Amelia lived a long a full life, dying in Baltimore, Maryland on April 24, 1983, at the age of 90."\r
