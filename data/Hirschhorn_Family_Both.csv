As a child, Max was a member of the Red Falcons, a group for children of socialist families, until the group was banned in 1934, upon which time he joined the also-illegal Communist Youth of Austria (KJÖ) organization. Max dropped out of school to start an apprenticeship, and sometime between then and 1938 he met his future wife, Ruth. It was she that brought him to the Hashomer Hatzair socialist-Zionist youth organization, through which the two of them were able to emigrate to England in early 1939, after the annexation of Austria in March of 1938.

In England, Max worked as a farm laborer until the outset of World War II. In 1940, he was interned in England, as well as for a time Canada, before being returned to England. He began working as a metalworker in the arms industry, and married Ruth on August 2, 1941 in Leamington Spa, England.

In early 1947, Max and Ruth were able to move back to Austria, and in 1948 Max earned the high school diploma he had not been able to receive. In 1947, Max became active in the Communist Party of Austria, holding multiple positions in various regional offices, including serving in Vienna as the regional secretary in the 1960s. However, he was voted out of office in 1968 due to his support of the Prague Spring, and he left the party. He went on to work in the private sector, and after his retirement started serving in schools as a contemporary witness against fascism.

When exactly he was in the United States, and what he did there, is unclear, as is whether or not he ever married or had children. It is also unknown when Eliasz Chaim died.

*interestingly enough, there was another man named Elias Hirschhorn born in Rzeszow just two months after Eliasz Chaim, on August 20, 1867. This Elias Hirschhorn did get married and had three sons, Maurycy, Ignacy, and Fryderyk, and currently has living descendants in Belgium today. He was the son of a Lipe Hirschhorn, who himself was the son of a Mojzesz Hirschhorn. While it is likely that this family is related to ours, as they were all neighbors in Rzeszow and shared a last name, it is unclear exactly how they are related, although Mojzesz Hirschhorn would have been the same generation as Abraham Wolf Hirschhorn, so it is possible they were brothers. The families certainly would have known each other, at the very least."

He was born on April 22, 1874 in Rzeszow, Poland. He appeared as living with his family in Rzeszow in the 1880, 1890, 1902, and 1910 censuses. By 1910, they were living in a building owned by Shulem Rosenwasser, the uncle of Ephraim's future wife Amelia Kornfeld, who he met when she went to live with her Uncle Shulem at the age of 14, after the deaths of both of her parents. 

Ephraim was a successful banker in Rzeszow; he was the manager of the Austro-Hungarian government bank in the city, and was well-known and well-respected. He was also well educated and well traveled, and was an ardent Zionist, involved in numerous organizations in Rzeszow including Poale Zion, a movement of Marxist-Zionist Jewish workers. In addition, he helped to found a Jewish newspaper in Rzeszow, although it only seems to have run for a few issues. Ephraim and Amelia were engaged in 1914. He was 40, she was 21. Amelia's Uncle Shulem disapproved of the union largely because of Ephraim's age, his involvement in the Zionist movement which Shulem was against, and because Ephraim was not very religious. 

Before they could get married, in late 1914, they fled Rzeszow to Prague, Czech Republic (then part of the Austrian Empire). Upon arriving in Prague, in December of 1914, they had a very rushed religious marriage, but did not have their official civil marriage until December 30, 1917. They had two sons in Prague, Isak Salomon (later Isidor) and David. Life in Prague was hard, as they were immigrants and did not have papers, not to mention that it was during World War I, but Ephraim found work at a refugee office and they were able to support themselves. They knew it was temporary. They had intended to return to Rzeszow. However, Amelia's brother Benjamin had by then established himself in the United States and wrote to her that they should join him. It took Amelia six months to persudae Ephraim to immigrate to the United States, but eventually she did.

They obtained their visas and left Prague, stopping first in Stuttgart to visit Ephraim's niece Philippine Ascher and her family, the Laubs, and then in Nuremberg to visit his brother Moses Jozef Hirschhorn and his family, before arriving in Cherbourg, France, in December of 1921. Upon arrival, they sat through a week long inspection, after which they were finally allowed to board the boat. However, after boarding, they received a message that they would have to debark: the border had been closed, and their sons would have been allowed to leave as they were Czech citizens, but Ephraim and Amelia would have to stay behind because they were Polish citizens. The whole family got off the boat, and remained in Cherbourg for six months, from December of 1921 until June of 1922. The day before their French visa would have run out, they were able to renew it. Eventually, they boarded the S.S. Majestic and set sail for the United States on June 28, 1922. They arrived in New York on July 4, 1922, and were welcomed by fireworks celebrating American Independence Day. The whole trip, Ephraim complained, but Amelia told him that if she could manage, he would be able to as well.

They were met in the United States by Amelia's brother Benjamin, who had been there since 1912. Ephraim and Benjamin did not get along well, but the family settled in to Newark, New Jersey, where Ephraim lived for the rest of his life. He did not take well to the United States and always harbored hopes of returning to Rzeszow, or making aliyah to Israel. Ephraim never learned English, and although Benjamin found him a job in a factory, Ephraim quit after a few days as he found it unfitting for a man with his background and experience to be working a job like that. He suffered health issues, including two strokes, the second of which caused his death in New Jersey on March 9, 1941. He was 66 years old. "
2m,Amelia Kornfeld,7 Apr 1893,"Olpiny, Podkarpackie, Poland",24 Apr 1983,"Baltimore, Maryland, USA",Solomon David Kornfeld,Beila Rosenwasser,Ephraim Hirschhorn,30 Dec 1917,"Prague, Prague, Czech Republic","Isidor Solomon Hirschhorn, David Hirschhorn",Abraham Schneider,10 Jun 1956,,,1.10m,"Amelia Kornfeld was the wife of Ephraim Hirschhorn. She was born on April 7, 1893, in the small town of Olpiny, Poland, to Solomon David Kornfeld and Beila Rosenwasser, their oldest child of four and only daughter. Her parents had been introduced to each other by the famous Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Nowy Sacz, where Beila's family was from. He was friends with both Solomon's father, Berl Kornfeld, and Beila's father, Joseph Rosenwasser. Amelia grew up in Olpiny, and went to Catholic school where the nun's who taught her called her by her mother's last name, Rosenwasser, since her parents had only had a religious marriage, not a civil one, so their marriage was not officially recognized. From a youing age Amelia had to help out with the housework and take care of her younger brothers, as her mother was often out of town peddling wares.

Amelia's mother died of tuberculosis in 1906, when Amelia was just 13, and her father died the next year of complications from a surgery. He had gone to Vienna for the operation and never returned. After both parents died, Amelia and her siblings were divided up among their mother's siblings: Benjamin went to live with an uncle in Nowy Wisnicz (likely Israel Rosenwasser, with his wife Gitel Gutfreund and their sons Simche and Judah), Joseph went to Nowy Sacz (likely to his aunt Scheindel Rosenwasser, with her husband Isaak Borgenicht and their children Mendel Leiser, Israel, and Perl), while Israel, at just 3 years old, was left with a Jewish woman who lived near Rzeszow, Poland, who they paid to take care of him. Amelia was also sent to Rzeszow, to live with her Uncle Shulem Rosenwasser, along with his wife Feige Reichwald and their two children, Zalman and Regina.

Shulem had a bit of a temper, but his wife was always kind to Amelia. Similarly, while she never got along too well with Regina, who was jealous of Amelia's good looks, she got along really well with Zalman, who was involved in the Zionist movement in Rzeszow. However, Shulem disapproved of Zionism and would often get angry with Zalman, and Amelia would often step in between the two to protect Zalman. Shulem ran a general store in Rzeszow, where Amelia was put to work. Instead of going to school, she learned to be a businesswoman. Above the store were apartments that Shulem rented out, including to the family of Ephraim Hirschhorn, who was involved in the Zionist movement with Zalman. Amelia and Ephraim fell in love, and were engaged in 1914, although Uncle Shulem disapproved of their engagement because Ephraim was almopst 20 years her senior, was not very religious, and was a Zionist.

Before they could get married, in late 1914, they fled Rzeszow to Prague, Czech Republic (then part of the Austrian Empire). Upon arriving in Prague, in December of 1914, they had a very rushed religious marriage, but did not have their official civil marriage until December 30, 1917.

During that time, Amelia learned French and took care of the family by cooking, cleaning, sewing, and taking on other odd jobs. The day before their French visa would have run out, they were able to renew them. Eventually, they boarded the S.S. Majestic and set sail for the United States on June 28, 1922.

They were met in the United States by Amelia's brother Benjamin, who had been there since 1912. Ephraim and Benjamin did not get along well, but the family settled in to Newark, New Jersey. Ephraim was not able to find work, so it was up to Amelia to take care of the family, and she did so by running a bed and breakfast out of their apartment. She raised her sons in Newark, where Ephraim died in 1941. Fifteen years later, Amelia remarried to Abraham Schneider, on June 10, 1956. Amelia lived a long a full life, dying in Baltimore, Maryland on April 24, 1983, at the age of 90."
